### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile :smile:

My name is Divya Bansal. I am a Data Engineering and Analytics Master's Graduate from the Technical University of Munich.
I am enthusiastic about all topics pertaining to data science, data engineering, machine learning and AI. 

ðŸ”­ I am actively looking for a fulltime opportunity in Germany...

âœ¨ An overview of my current skillset:
---
**Techniques**
1. Data Analysis (EDA, visualization, statistical modelling)
2. Data Engineering (ETL, cloud computing/deployment)
3. ML/DL algorithms (traditional and modern) (NLP, CV, Tabular, Time-Series) 
4. Software Engineering/Development

**Toolbox**
1. Python (Advanced): Used it extensively in professional and university projects. Can confidently develop data engineering/analysis/ML/DL solutions and scripts.
2. SQL (Advanced): Used it extensively in my previous work experience, also learned query optimization at a university course.
3. C/C++/Java (Basic): Used in several projects but not in the recent years. To highlight, used former for advanced parallel programming using OpenMP and MPI and latter for Spring/OOP/Android development.
4. HTML/CSS (Basic): Can develop basic website/email templates and can read and understand code for web scraping 
5. Linux (Advanced):  Used it extensively in professional and university projects. Used most basic functions, wrote basic bash scripts, set up a virtual cluster of computers(at LRZ), worked with remote machines (ssh, scp, port forwarding) etc.
6. MongoDB, Microsoft Power BI, PySpark, Hadoop, Ansible (Basic): Fundamental understanding and some project experience 
7. Docker, AWS (S3, EC2, Sagemaker), Airflow, Jenkins (Basic): Fundamental understanding and personal project experience with these tools
8. Git, SVN, Autosys/cron, JIRA, Confluence, MS Office (Advanced): Used it extensively in professional and university projects

 
After delaying it for many years, from now on I pledge to revise and showcase my abilities through this profile and also contribute to some open source projects.
